# Specification Quality Checklist: Elapsed time and the advance-time command

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass; ready for `/kord-feature-clarify` (expected to find nothing outstanding) and
  `/kord-feature-plan`. Scope was narrowed to a library operation (no CLI wiring) after
  confirming no chronicle-level CLI/session-loop entry point exists anywhere yet in this
  codebase for any sibling feature under epic #301 or #300 — see spec.md's Assumptions.
